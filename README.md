# House Pricing Dataset Analysis
A comprehensive analysis of the House Pricing dataset with various regression models and feature selection techniques.
Score on Kaggle: 1.12

## Data Science Workflow
* Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data through summary statistics and visualizations.
* Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
* Feature Selection: Identifying and selecting the most important features for the models
* Model Building: Selecting and training regression models.
* Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of models using appropriate metrics.
* Deployment: Implementing the model in a production environment.
* Feature Importance Testing: Using techniques like feature importance and permutation importance to evaluate feature relevance.

## Technical - General
### Programming Languages
* Python: Widely used for its simplicity and extensive libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

### Environments
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Revision Control: Git

## Data Manipulation and Cleaning
* Data manipulation: Pandas for handling missing values using imputation techniques such as mean annd mode.
* Data Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn: creating histograms, box plots, correlation plots, scatter plots, and probability plots.
* Feature Selection: eliminated highly correlated features, low-variance features, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) technique, finding the most target correlated features

## Technical - Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
* Linear models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet).
* Tree-based models (Random Forest).
* Cross-validation techniques & Hyperparameter tuning: K-Fold Cross-Validation and Grid Seatch
* Metrics: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R^2 score.
